## Overview
### General Note
This project may not be responsive with mobile phones and some tablets due to lack of time for media queries. The design is meant to have a desktop view first.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
